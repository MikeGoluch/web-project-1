This project is a game called ["The Pig Game"](https://mikegoluch.github.io/web-project-1/). The idea for this content came from Jonas Schmedtmans Udemy course called "The complete javascript course". Main rules for this game are:
***
- Two players compete during rounds. In each round, one of the player rolls the dice as many times as he wants. Each result is added to his current score. But there is a catch, everytime player rolls a "1" on one of the dices his current score is lost and so is his turn. Until then the player can choose "Hold" button to store his current points in a global score. After that it's the next players turn.
The first player to reach the "X" points on global score wins the game. The limit of points is set by the player in the beginning.
***
Enjoy the game!
